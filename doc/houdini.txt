INTRO                                                 *houdini* *houdini.nvim*

If you are using a custom key mapping like `jk` to leave insert, terminal or
command mode you probably have noticed that there is a slight "delay" after
typing the first character. This is Neovim waiting for |timeoutlen| to see if
you type the second character of your mapping or if it should insert the
character instead.

With `houdini` the characters will be inserted into the buffer right away.
After each character the plugin checks if you have typed on of the configured
escape sequences within the timeout. If this the case the corresponding
sequence will be triggered, which by default will delete the inserted
characters and escape the current mode. This way you will not experience any
delay while typing.

To check the already typed characters `houdini` uses the builtin
|vim.on_key()| function.

==============================================================================
INSTALLATION                                            *houdini-installation*

The plugin requires at least Neovim version >= 0.5

Install with your favorite plugin manager and call the `setup` function.

CONFIGURATION                                          *houdini-configuration*

You need to call the `setup` function at least once, which will by default
initialize `houdini` with its default settings:
>
    require('houdini').setup {
        mappings = { 'jk' },
        timeout = vim.o.timeoutlen,
        check_modified = true,
        escape_sequences = {
            i = '<BS><BS><ESC>',
            R = '<BS><BS><ESC>',
            t = '<BS><BS><C-\\><C-n>',
            c = '<BS><BS><C-c>',
        },
    }
<
By passing your own configuration table to the `setup` function you can
override these defaults with your own preference:
>
	require('houdini').setup {
		mappings = { 'fd' }
	}
<
The `setup` function is idempotent, so you can call it multiple times with
different configurations and it will always overwrite the previous settings
(no restart required). This might be helpful when testing for example
different timeout values or custom escape sequences.

MAPPINGS                                             *houdini-config-mappings*

A list of two character mappings that you would like to use to trigger the
"escaping".

If you just want to "smash" two keys for escaping without having to care about
the order of them, you simply have to add both combinations to the list:
>
    mappings = { 'fd', 'df' }
<
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TIMEOUT                                               *houdini-config-timeout*

The time (in ms) in which both keys have to be pressed to trigger the escape.
Defaults to |timeoutlen|.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHECK MODIFIED                                 *houdini-config-check-modified*

Neovim will always mark a buffer as |modified| after you've escaped insert
mode via `houdini`. This is because inserting and deleting characters is
considered a "change", even if you did not change any text (see |changetick|).
With this option enabled `houdini` will compare the changes made after leaving
insert mode and suppress the |modified| status by Neovim, so that it works
more like pressing `<ESC>`.

This feature will not do anything in the following cases:

- the buffer was |modified| already before entering insert mode
- you changed some text while entering insert mode using for example |S|, |C|
  or |o|

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ESCAPE SEQUENCES                             *houdini-config-escape-sequences*

These are the escape sequences used to exit a certain mode.

You can provide another string sequence or even a Lua function which receives
both chars as parameters for even more customization:
>
	require('houdini').setup {
		mappings = { 'jk', 'AA', 'II' },
		escape_sequences = {
			i = function(first, second)
				local seq = first..second

				if seq == 'AA' then
					-- jump to the end of the line in insert mode
					return '<BS><BS><End>'
				end

				if seq == 'II' then
					-- jump to the beginning of the line in insert mode
					return '<BS><BS><Home>'
				end

				-- you can also deactivate houdini for certain
				-- occasions by simply returning an empty string
				if vim.opt.filetype:get() == 'TelescopePrompt' then
					return ''
				end

				return '<BS><BS><ESC>'
			end,
		},
	}
<
Note: By setting the escape sequence of a mode to `false` you're deactivating
`houdini` for this mode completely.

TROUBLESHOOTING                                      *houdini-troubleshooting*

There is a known issue with `lightspeed.nvim` which blocks the first `<BS>`
after a jump and changing text:
https://github.com/ggandor/lightspeed.nvim/issues/140

This might conflict with the default escape sequence for insert mode.
Fortunately there is a simple workaround to mitigate this problem:
>
	vim.cmd('autocmd User LightspeedSxLeave normal a')
